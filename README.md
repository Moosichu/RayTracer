This is where I am uploading the code of a very basic raytracer that I am making in C++.

I would also like to give a huge thanks to Casey Muratori for letting me use some of the code he wrote for Handmade Hero as a framebuffer for me to draw the renders to.

You can find handmade hero at [https://handmadehero.org/](https://handmadehero.org/), which I would recommend to anyone looking for a place to learn about game programming from scratch in C!
